# To be or not to be

## ~~That is the question~~ These are the questions

4.1. 1000, which is the population size.

4.2. Go through the genes list and compare it with target character by character. If characters match, add score by 1. Later devide the total score by
the length of target to calculate the fitness level.

4.3. 1 / 18 = 0.556

4.4. We can calculate the squre of differene between genes and target's characters. Instead of optimizing fitness score to 1, now we can try to optimize
the square difference (variance) to 0.

4.5. If the current algorithm doesn't have the right element by design, we can randomly introduce new elements to the algorithm and help it to acquire that element.
