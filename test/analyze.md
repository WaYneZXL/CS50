# Analyze This

## Questions

1a. Yes, the algorithm is correct

1b. The upper bound of this algorithm is O(n^2). Because when he tries to find all cards end with 9, it takes (n - a)a times, with a equals to the number of cards
that end with 9. Similar with cards end with 8, 7, 6, ...., 0, eventually the number of times is n (a + b + c + ... + j) = n * n = n^2

2a. Yes, the algorithm is correct

2b. The upper bound of its run time is still O(n^2). ALthough the new algotithm may run faster in certain situations, its upper bound run tims is still the same as the
original bubble algorithm, which is O(n^2).

3a. Yes, the algorithm is correct in the sense that it will help you find the card (if it's in the deck).

3b. The upper bound of its run tims is O(n), because it looks at 1 card at a time and the maximum number of cards is n.
