## Questions

1. Did you try to do reminder operation with float data type? It only works with integers! Check your delcaration of n and try again.

2. You're using "get_string" without prompting it which content it should get. Try get_string().

3. You're trying to compare a char, which is an integer smaller than 128, with a number 255. Therefore, the result is always false. Try another way of comparison.

4. You're declare a pointer to a node that is not able to link to another node, therefore the error message.
